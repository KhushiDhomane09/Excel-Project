# Excel-Project
In this project I use hotel_booking.csv dataset from kaggle.
There are multiple fields in the dtaset but I only use the important field which will be use to analyse the the cancellations of the booking in the hotel such as fields like by year and monthe , by couples, family friends, etc.
Here I use various visualization charts like column chart, pie chart, bar chart, slicer to analyze the fields.
